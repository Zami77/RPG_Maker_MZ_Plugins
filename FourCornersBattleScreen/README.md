# Four Corners Battle Screen
This plugin creates a battle look similar to the game Omori. The actor portraits are drawn in each corner of the screen.
Recomment first person battles as space can get tight.

## Features
* Dictate which actor is drawn in which location
* Can have 1-4 actors
* Battle log will adjust position if top layer is open

## Screenshots

## How to use
The only user action necesarry is to put the correct actor id into each of the parameters, it defaults to <br>
* Bottom Left  => 1 <br>
* Borrom Right => 2 <br>
* Upper Right  => 3 <br>
* Upper Left   => 4 <br>

Putting the same actor id for multiple positions will get undesired results. The plugin will function fine if a number is passed as a parameter
but the actor does not exist. You can also place actors in any assortment of setups i.e. actor in bottom left and upper right only.
